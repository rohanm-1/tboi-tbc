# True Black Candle 🕯 (TBoI Mod)
<h3>This is a simple mod I made for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance called True Black Candle (TBC).</h3>

The mod essentially negates the pills like Amnesia and ??? from working if the player has the Black Candle. 
The Black Candle negates the player from having curses, but the aforementioned pills would still affect the player,
giving them curses like Curse of the Lost or Curse of the Maze.

I wanted to make a modthat I would personally use while playing. I never understood why you were able to get these curses 
after all the curses have been negated with the item so I decided to do something about it 😤

This project exposed me to so many new technologies I never knew existed. It taught me a lot about coding in Lua and XML files as well as being able to efficiently understand documentation.
